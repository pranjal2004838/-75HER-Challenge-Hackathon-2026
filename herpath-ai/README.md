## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions (Why These Choices?)

### 1. **Custom Goose Implementation vs. Official goose-ai Package**
**Decision**: Build our own Goose-style framework instead of `pip install goose-ai`

**Why**:
- ❌ `goose-ai` package requires Node.js and has Python 3.14 compatibility issues with older pydantic v1
- ❌ Dependencies conflict with our Firebase setup
- ✅ Building custom gives us: full control, zero dependency conflicts, faster iteration
- ✅ Demonstrates deep understanding of agentic AI patterns (Plan-Execute-Verify loops)

**Tradeoff**: ~2,000 LOC of custom code vs. using a published package. Worth it for: reliability + control + judge impression.

---

### 2. **Google Gemini API vs. OpenAI / Anthropic**
**Decision**: Use Gemini 3 Flash for all LLM calls

**Why**:
- ✅ **Free tier**: $300 credits = unlimited demo testing (OpenAI charges per token)
- ✅ **Speed**: Flash model = 200-300ms response time (good for UX)
- ✅ **Multimodal ready**: Supports text + images (future feature)
- ✅ **Availability**: More stable for hackathon than rate-limited APIs
- ❌ **Less precise** than GPT-4 or Claude 3.5, but good enough for 2-week MVP

**Tradeoff**: Slightly lower output quality vs. cost-free testing + speed. Fallback system mitigates this.

---

### 3. **Streamlit (Frontend) vs. FastAPI/React (Web App)**
**Decision**: Streamlit for UI, no separate API server

**Why**:
- ✅ **Rapid prototype**: Build full app in 2 days (React + FastAPI = 4+ days)
- ✅ **State management**: Streamlit handles sessions automatically
- ✅ **Perfect for MVP**: Interactive data apps are Streamlit's strength
- ✅ **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud = 1 Click, no DevOps
- ❌ **Not production-ready** for high-traffic APIs (100+ concurrent users)
- ❌ **Not suitable** for REST API integration (mobile apps can't use it)

**Tradeoff**: Hackathon speed > production scalability. For post-hack: migrate backend to FastAPI, deploy frontend separately.

---

### 4. **Firebase Firestore vs. PostgreSQL / MongoDB**
**Decision**: Firebase handles both auth + database

**Why**:
- ✅ **Zero setup**: Auth + database + hosting bundled
- ✅ **Serverless**: No DevOps until needed
- ✅ **Real-time sync**: Realtime Database updates UI instantly
- ✅ **Free tier sufficient**: 1 GB storage + 25K daily reads = plenty for demo
- ❌ **Vendor lock-in**: Harder to migrate later
- ❌ **NoSQL only**: No complex joins (not an issue for this schema)

**Tradeoff**: Speed + simplicity now > future flexibility. Firebase is the right call for hackathon MVP.

---

### 5. **Rule-Based Rebalancing vs. ML-Learned Thresholds**
**Decision**: Hard-coded rules (>30% missed tasks, >20% ahead, etc.)

**Why**:
- ✅ **Transparent**: Judges can see exact decision logic
- ✅ **Trustworthy**: No black-box ML models
- ✅ **Adjustable**: Easy to tweak thresholds based on feedback
- ✅ **Data**: No historical data yet to train ML models
- ❌ **Not adaptive**: Can't learn from user population

**Tradeoff**: Simplicity now > personalization at scale. ML comes in v2 with user data.

---

## ⚠️ Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Gemini API outage** | Demo fails silently | Low | Hardcoded fallback responses + error logging (see [fallback.py](agents/goose/fallback.py)) | ✅ Implemented |
| **Firebase auth issues** | Can't load user data | Medium | Demo mode with pre-seeded account (run `seed_demo_account.py`) | ✅ Implemented |
| **Vague roadmap generation** | Tasks unhelpful ("learn Python") | High | System prompts enforce specificity: exact LeetCode #s, course names, URLs (see [roadmap_agent.py](agents/roadmap_agent.py#L20-L80)) | ✅ Implemented |
| **AI generates invalid JSON** | Parser crashes | Medium | Response validation + auto-retry (max 3 attempts, 45s timeout) | ✅ Implemented |
| **Infinite loops in rebalance** | App hangs | Low | Max steps = 3, timeout = 45 seconds per agent call | ✅ Implemented |
| **Rate limit on Gemini API** | Requests rejected | Low | Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s waits) + queue system | ✅ Implemented |
| **Firebase secrets leak** | Credentials exposed | Low | Secrets stored in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (git-ignored) | ✅ Implemented |
| **Imposter syndrome in system prompt not detected** | User gets generic advice | Medium | NLP keywords in fallback manager ("don't belong", "imposter", "fake") | ✅ Implemented |

**Risk Fixed During Development:**
- ✅ **Initial Issue**: Infinite retry loops in LLM calls
  - **Fix Applied**: Added `max_retries=2` + `timeout_seconds=45.0` to `GooseAgent`
  - **Evidence**: See [agents/goose/agent.py](agents/goose/agent.py#L140-L160)

---

## 🔄 Tradeoffs Explained

### Speed vs. Accuracy
- **Choice**: Use Gemini Flash (faster) over Gemini Pro (slower but more accurate)
- **Why**: In a hackathon, iteration velocity beats output perfection
- **Fallback**: System prompts are hyper-specific to compensate for lower model quality

### Scope vs. Depth
- **Choice**: 4 roles (AI Engineer, Web Dev, Data Analyst, Career Re-entry) instead of 20 roles
- **Why**: Better to deeply understand 4 niches than shallowly cover 20
- **Result**: Each role has hyper-specific curriculum (LeetCode #s, course names, etc.)

### Free Resources vs. Paid Alternatives
- **Choice**: Prioritize free resources, suggest paid only when necessary
- **Why**: Respects financial constraints of women re-entering tech (often have gaps in income)
- **Implementation**: See `financial_constraint` in [onboarding.py](ui/onboarding.py#L150)

### Centralized Data vs. Distributed Agent State
- **Choice**: All state in Firebase + Redis (eventually), agents are stateless
- **Why**: Easier to scale, debug, and iterate when state is centralized
- **Fallback**: If Firebase down, use in-memory cache for demo mode

### Empathy-First Design vs. Pure Optimization
- **Choice**: Include affirmations, streak tracking, "You belong here" messages
- **Why**: Women experience higher imposter syndrome in tech; psychological support matters
- **Data**: System detects emotional signals from background text and adjusts pacing

- ✅ Pydantic models for all data structures (see [schema.py](database/schema.py))
- ✅ Runtime validation of all API responses

### Documentation
- ✅ Docstrings on every function and class
- ✅ Inline comments for complex logic
- ✅ Architecture diagrams in this README

### Error Handling
- ✅ Try-catch on all external API calls
- ✅ Structured logging (see [utils/logging.py](utils/logging.py))
- ✅ Graceful fallback responses

### Testing
```bash
# Validate demo account works
python seed_demo_account.py

# Check Firebase connectivity
python view_firebase_data.py

# Run app locally
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🛠️ API Configuration

### Exponential Backoff Strategy
```python
# Automatic retry with exponential backoff
retries = 3
for attempt in range(retries):
    try:
        response = call_api()
        break
    except TransientError:
        wait = 2 ** attempt  # 1s, 2s, 4s
        time.sleep(wait)
```

### Timeout Handling
```python
# All API calls have 30s timeout
response = requests.post(
    url, json=payload,
    timeout=30  # Guaranteed response or exception
)
```

### Rate Limiting
- **Gemini API**: 60 calls/minute (handled gracefully)
- **Firebase**: No limits on free tier
